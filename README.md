<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
![Product Name Screen Shot][screenshot]


**TreLire** is a wp_mail tester plugin. Want to be sure WordPress is able to send what it needs, when it needs it? You're a plugin away from that.

### How it works
TreLire adds a page to the WordPress' tools, and makes you able to send emails from there. You can personalize your email as you want, by adding
* Content Type
* Multiple recipients
* Sender
* Reply-to
* CC
* BCC
* Subject
* Attachments, using WP's media uploader.
* HTML body



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

You can just clone this repository inside your `wp-content/plugins` folder, or [download the installable zip](https://github.com/caffeinalab/trelire/zipball/master) and install it via the WordPress dashboard. 

### Updates
Right now, you have to manually update the plugin by checking this GitHub repo.


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To use TreLire, just install it to your WordPress website and click on the Tools menu. You can now send emails and test your WordPress website.
