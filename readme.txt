TreLire is a wp_mail tester plugin. Want to be sure WordPress is able to send what it needs, when it needs it? You\'re a plugin away from that.


== Description ==
TreLire adds a page to the WordPress\' tools, and makes you able to send emails from there. You can personalize your email as you want, by adding
* Content Type
* Multiple recipients
* Sender
* Reply-to
* CC
* BCC
* Subject
* Attachments, using WP\'s media uploader.
* HTML body

== Installation ==
To use TreLire, just install it to your WordPress website and click on the Tools menu. You can now send emails and test your WordPress website.
Need to use SMTP instead of your provider\'s mail? Check [Postino](https://github.com/caffeinalab/postino)!
